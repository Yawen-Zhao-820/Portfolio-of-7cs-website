						Hi! I am Yawen Zhao. I am currently studying for a Master of Information Technology at the University of Queensland. I like to design and programming. After I graduate, I hope to work in web development. I enjoy photography and collage art in my free time, and I have previously worked on product shoots for various companies. I hope that one day I can bring beauty to the audience through the website. I am always interested in any opportunity that can learn new skills and expand my experience.

			<div id="team-img"><img src="./images/team.jpg" alt="team photo"></div>
			<div id="project-text">
				<p>
					7Cs is a website designed for those who want to plan their routes to see the coral reefs. By clicking on the blue areas and markers on the homepage map, users can view information about reefs and predicated tide levels. Then they can add reefs that they are interested in their routes. The website will automatically link all the reefs chosen by the user and generate a path. The purpose of 7Cs is to make it easy for users to look for coral reefs they interested in and plan travel routes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					My project's role as both designer and developer includes creating a low-fidelity prototype, designing interactions, illustrating the use case diagram, implementing the primary function through JavaScript, etc. The project has gone through a series of iterations based on group discussion and peer feedback. This portfolio will introduce my contributions and reflections on each part of the project and the whole course.

				<h3>Part A</h3>
				<h4 class="part-sub">Design Concept Proposal and Pitch</h4>
			</div>
			
			<hr>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Overview</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					The goal of Part A was to do background research, explore datasets via data.gov.au and produce the design concept of the project. In Part A, we discussed several different ideas and finally decided to choose the coral reef concept based on the datasets we could find for the website. Then we divided the design concept document into sections, with each person responsible for some.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Design exploration before Part A</h4>
				<br>
			</div>

			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					In the first three weeks of contact sessions, we were guided by tutors to do design exploration. We started by brainstorming with the data on data.gov.au. We discussed in groups, wrote our ideas on the Miro board and iterated these ideas. After the activities, we started to do individual research for week 4’s pitch. When we discussed in the group, the discussion was guided by my classmates, and they picked the topic of education. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					However, I thought it hard to find exciting datasets on education topics. And I was personally not interested in this topic. After researching datasets and similar websites, I decided to pick ‘bird’ as my topic since there are more than 800 kinds of birds in Australia, and there are so many datasets related to birds that I can use. I considered the target audience and made personas. I designed rich user interactions and drew a use case diagram to show it. Also, I sketch the homepage to represent my idea directly. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I felt a little nervous when doing the pitch, but I was satisfied with my pitch. My tutors and peers liked my idea. However, I did not do very well designing the poster since it was the first time for me to create a poster. I wanted to contain everything in my poster, and it caused too many texts on my poster. I could do better next time.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The design exploration before Part A was beneficial. We combined every team members’ idea in Part A. The dataset we used for the primary function was from one of our team members' research in design exploration. And the final product was similar to my sketch for the bird topic. Also, what we did in the design exploration made us very clear about what we should do when working on the group project.

			<div class="subtitle-sub">
				<h5>1. Researched different ideas</h5>
			</div>

			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					The project began with group brainstorming. My original idea was making an interactive map for bird lovers. Users could see locations of birds on the map with a brief introduction and photos. I created sketches and a poster for this idea. The low fidelity prototype in part A was based on the sketches I made for my original idea.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					In the group meeting, we discussed every team members’ idea and tried to combine them. Because of the limitation of datasets, in the beginning, we decided to choose fishing combined with extreme weather as there were many datasets about fish on data.gov.au. We did much research on this topic. But we found these datasets could not be used to create an interactive map. So, we decided to change the topic to coral reefs because one of our team members found very suitable datasets.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>2. Designed logo of the website</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-11">

				<div>
					<img src="./images/part-A-logo-04.PNG" alt="logo">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					After we decided what to do, we started to guess the name and logo of the website. The name of our website is 7Cs, which means seven seas. So, I designed the logo based on the name.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The first version of the logo included a ship with “7Cs”. I drew a pair of eyes on the logo to show another meaning of 7Cs: seven sees. The colour of the logo kept consistent with the low fidelity prototype I designed.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We changed the colour theme many times, and every time we changed the colour theme, I kept changing the logo to make it consistent with the whole website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>3. Created low fidelity prototype and clarified user interactions</h5>

					<img src="./images/partA-3.9.PNG" alt="report">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					After we discussed the purpose of our website, we decided to include these main functions on the website: 1. searching reefs in the search bar; 2. showing areas with extreme weather on the map; 3. showing top 10 popular reefs on the map; 4. adding reefs to travel routes and show planned ways on the map;
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After we finished the discussion, I started to create the low-fidelity prototype, which shows how the website responds to user interaction. I also clarified all the user interactions in the design report. I used the same colour theme and layout with the sketches of my original idea. I did not know that we could change the map colour at this stage, so I did not consider the colour theme much. We discussed and tested a lot of different colour themes in Part C.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>4. Drew use case diagram</h5>
				<br>
				<img src="./images/use-case.jpg" alt="use case diagram">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					I have drawn a use case diagram for my poster, so I was very familiar with it. We discussed the target audience in a group meeting. There were two kinds of the target audience for our website: experts and regular users. The search function was explicitly designed for experts who have related knowledge about coral reefs since normal users would not know the unique ID, name or type of the reef. The regular users might be interested in coral reefs and tried to see coral reefs on their own without travel agencies. I created the use case diagram based on the target audience.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>5. Scope of the website and layout of personas</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-03">

					<img src="./images/persona-01.PNG" alt="persona 01">

					<img src="./images/persona-02.PNG" alt="persona 02">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					To make the style of the design report consistent. I made the template of personas that had the same colour theme with the low fidelity prototype. I also wrote the draft of the website's scope to clarify what our website would do and why.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>6. Made slides of user interactions part</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-04">
				<div>
					<img src="./images/slides-01.PNG" alt="slides 01">

			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					After we finished the report, we started to prepare for the pitch. I summarized the essential points and made slides of user interactions. I tried to make the slides concise and clear. And I also used the same colour theme to make the slides consistent with the prototype of our website.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					I think Part A was successful. We decided on the straightforward design concept of the website after researching and discussing several different ideas. Then we divided the design concept document into several sections. Everyone chose the part that they were good at. We did our own parts in the library together. We brought up any issues right away and discussed them together. All team members staying in the library to do part A together made the teamwork incredibly efficient. After we finished the concept document, we divided the pitch into several parts and practiced the presentation together in the same way. We pitched our concept in class confidently. Part A gave a clear direction for Part B and Part C. The final product is very similar to the low fidelity prototype in Part A.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I would do more research on datasets and leave more time for Part A if it arose again. In the beginning, we discussed every team member’s idea and decided to choose fishing as our topic. However, we could not find suitable datasets (distribution locations and photos of different kinds of fish) and finally changed the topic to coral reefs. This wasted too much time. According to tutors and peers' feedback, some of them thought our website was not attractive enough. If we had more time in Part A, we could have designed more exciting interactions to make our website more attractive.

				<h3>Part B</h3>
				<h4 class="part-sub">Demonstration Progress & Brief</h4>
			</div>

			<hr>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Overview</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					In this stage, we have implemented the website partially. We introduced our MVP, interaction plan, development process and challenges in class. We also displayed our demo and asked questions to our peers. We got many essential and useful feedbacks in part B.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>My contribution</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle-sub">
				<h5>1. Implemented the basic structure of the websites</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<img src="./images/2.1.PNG" alt="first version of website">
				<br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					In Part B, we started to implement the website. To begin developing functions earlier, I implemented the basic structure of the website without any visual design. Although it was ugly, we could modify the layout or add functions to the website based on it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>2. Implemented part of MVP of the website</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-07">
				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.2.jpg" alt="MVP 01">
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.3.jpg" alt="MVP 02">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					After I implemented the website's basic structure, I started to work on the development of main functions immediately since all of us did not know much about accessing API and GeoJSON, and we did not know how much time we would spend on it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Our MVP included: 1. Showing locations of reefs on the map. 2. Popping up relevant information. 3. Show the tide level of different places on the map after the user clicks on the corresponding position. 4. Showing shipping area map.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I implemented the first two successfully through self-learning. The API of the reefs locations is different from what we learned in the workshop, so it takes quite a lot of effort and time to access it and display the locations of reefs on the map. After I succeeded, I tried to make it better.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The API of coral reefs serves GeoJSON, so after some further exploration, I changed how the website shows the reefs on the map, in which the website shows the locations of reefs on not only the map but also the size and shape of every reef. After a discussion with team members, we decided to choose this one to make the website more useful to users.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>3. Designed maps in different color styles</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-05">
				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.4.png" alt="color 01">
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.5.PNG" alt="color 02">

					<img src="./images/2.6.PNG" alt="color 03">
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.7.PNG" alt="color 04">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					At this stage, we have implemented the MVP of our website. So, we started to think about the aesthetics of our website. However, the default colour of the leaflet map limits the colour theme of the website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After doing some research, I learned to use Mapbox to override the leaflet's map style. I designed several maps with different colour themes: 1. Light colour theme: light blue and pale pink. 2. Dark colour theme: dark blue and orange. 3. Dark colour theme: light blue and dark grey. We planned to test the colours in Part C, so we randomly picked one of them for Part B’s demo.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					I think Part B was very successful. Part B was the part that made me feel the most fulfilled and joyful. Although we have encountered many difficulties and challenges, overcoming them has given me a great sense of accomplishment and made me more confident. We spent more time on Part B than Part A and got much essential feedbacks. Changes in Part C are based on this feedback.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					However, I would try to implement more functions in Part B and leave more time to Part C to test our code and make the final product better if I had another chance. Before the trade show, one of our group members found a bug in the search function in testing, and we almost did not have time to fix it. And if we had implemented more functions in Part B, we could have gotten more useful feedback from tutors and peers to improve the final product.

				<h4>Overview</h4>

				<p>
					Part C was the final part of this project. In part C, we implemented our website entirely, finished the final design report and introduced our final product at the trade show.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>My contribution</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="subtitle-sub">
				<h5>1. Participated in testing maps in different color styles</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<img src="./images/2.1.PNG" alt="first version of website">
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					According to the feedback we got from tutors and peers, we found that some liked the colour theme very much, but some thought we should consider the colour theme. Some students said the dark grey oceans and light blue land on the map were different from users’ expectations, confusing.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We tested all the colour themes we designed for our website, as we planned in Part B. Since almost every member of our group has visual impairments, and one of us has colour blind, I think our test results are meaningful.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The results showed that we needed two different colours with high contrast to represent land and ocean so that users with colour blind could see the map clearly. Also, for people with high myopia and severe dry eye, the dark grey ocean was better than the light blue sea since users would look at the ocean part most of the time when using the website. If the ocean's colour were a light colour, users who had visual impairments would feel uncomfortable after using the website for several minutes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So, based on the results, we decided not to change the colour theme we used in Part B to ensure that the users with visual impairments feel comfortable using the website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>2. Implemented routing function by routing machine</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="img-slides-04">

				<div>
					<img src="./images/2.9.PNG" alt="routing 02">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					We started to figure out how to implement the most challenging part of our website, the routing function. The first version of this function was implemented by one of my teammates, which only connected all the points selected by the user. This version did not pass our test.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So, I tried to use a leaflet plugin called Routing Machine to generate routes for the user. However, this version also did not pass our test because it could only create land routes, not on the sea. Although Routing Machine gave weird routes, I felt happy when the website generated the path successfully. I think I can create routing functions on the land the next time I make a map-related website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>3. Generated waiting gif and added it to the website</h5>
				<br>
				<div>
					<img src="./images/gif-image.gif" alt="gif image">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<br>
				<p>
					Since it took time for the data to load, I made a gif by https://loading.io/ and added it to the website. When users entered the website, the loading gif would show. However, the final product did not contain the waiting gif because my teammates added a guide window. Every time the user opens the website, he/she will see the guide window first. When the user closes this window, the data is already loaded. So, we finally decided not to use the waiting gif to shorten the users’ waiting time.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle-sub">
				<h5>4. Discussion of development process in final report</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					Since I participated in the development of almost every feature of the website and kept track of the development process, I was responsible for the final report section, which discussed the development process and challenges. We encountered many difficulties and challenges in the whole development process. By keeping track of the development process, I felt that I made much progress this semester through this course, both in terms of improving my learning and teamwork skills.

				<h5>5. Slides and presentation for trade show</h5>

 					I selected a few representative versions of the website, summarized the development process, made the slides, and presented it at the trade show. This was my first time to attend a trade show, and I was very nervous. We practiced many times before the trade show. The trade show ended successfully, and the teachers in our channel liked the website. At this point, we finally finished this project. Looking back on the whole semester, I feel that the entire process is enriching and happy.

				<h4>Reflection</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					Overall, 7Cs was successful for me. We considered readability and accessibility based on the feedback we received in Part B. We tested all the colour theme and chose the one which is most friendly to people with visual impairments and colour blind. We added a guide window and adjusted the font size. As a person with visual impairment, I like the final product. Moreover, we practiced many times together for the trade show, and our presentation for the trade show was very smooth and successful.

					However, we were not able to refine the pathfinding algorithm. The algorithm we used for the routing function was a very simple sorting algorithm. Our ability limited the final product. I’ll try to improve this feature after I learn more about algorithms.

					I have never made a portfolio before this course, so I did some researches, checked the requirements on Blackboard and drew drafts for this website. I want to make my portfolio easy to view and responsive to the website I made last semester. I also want a cover like a cover of a book for this portfolio on which is my name, so that the audience will see my name at first sight. I chose to use a dark colour theme with aquatic colours to commemorate the project we did this semester. Then I drew the drafts based on my need.

				<h4>Development</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					I wrote the contents of the portfolio first before I started to code because I think I may change the website's layout based on the quantity of the contents. I want all the text to be ready at first.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After I finished writing, I started to create HTML and CSS with real content. I kept using inspect and zoom the website's size to check if the website looked weird on the phone. Since I had many screenshots and photos, I chose to use a plugin named slick to make a dynamic image gallery so that these pictures would not make the portfolio's layout cluttered. In the development process, I found that it was inconvenient for the audience if the navigation bar was not fixed on the top of the page since every part of my portfolio was long. So, I decided to change my original design and fixed the navigation bar on the top of the portfolio.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I also changed the distribution of the content many times. Because Part A, Part B and Part C are very long, I put their links directly on the navigation bar so that the audience can click on the navigation bar to go to a specific location without scrolling for a long time to skip a part. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I chose to put the part of Design Exploration in Part A because I think the design exploration section is closely related to Part A. Most of our ideas in Part A came from Design Exploration. And I put Participation & Journaling in the Course Reflection section because Participation and Journaling ran throughout the whole semester. Otherwise, I did not want too many links on the navigation bar, so I combined related parts.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I tried to use animate.css to add animations to my portfolio. When the audience enters my portfolio, my name will drop from outside the page, making my portfolio look more fantastic than static ones.
				</p>

				<h4>Reflection</h4>

					I think the portfolio was successful. I like the layout and aesthetics of my portfolio. I put all the process I made during this semester into it. I got a sense of accomplishment after I finished the portfolio. However, I planned to try more new cool things on my portfolio like fullpage.js. But I have added too much content to my portfolio. It seemed not suitable to use fullpage.js to implement my portfolio. Next time, I would try fullpage.js on my portfolio. Also, I think I lack the visual design ability. It took me much effort to design a visual appearance. I need to do more research on graphic design. I could make a more fantastic portfolio next time.

				<h4>Participation & Journaling</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					In this course, participation is essential. It is not only because of marks but also because we would not catch up with the project's process if we did not actively participate in the contact session and workshop session. All the lectures, contacts and workshops of this course are beneficial to the group project and our future personal development.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					For example, if I did not participate in every weeks’ workshop, I would have no idea how to start developing our website because I have never known about interactive maps, API and JSON. In the workshop of week 4, we learned how to access API. In the workshop of week 6, we learned about Leaflet and where to start to create an interactive map. Actually, our final product's primary function was based on the knowledge we learned from these two workshops. Although we learned more on our own than what teachers taught in class during the project's whole development process, the knowledge we learned from the course gave us a way forward.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The journaling is beneficial too. This is the first time that I have been asked to write journals in a course. It is a new feeling to me. These journaling assignments have made me a good habit to keep track of the process of our project. Looking over these records I left through the whole semester, I feel that I have done and learned a lot in just 12 weeks. Keeping tracking the process, being open to feedback, make reflection and iterating the product are the best things I learned from this course. I will use this good habit in other classes and even on my job in the future.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I also learned how to critique other people’s work. In JP2, I critiqued my peer’s poster and my peer critiqued my poster. And in JP4, I critiqued on peers’ JP3. Writing these critiques helped me avoid the mistakes peers had made, and it gave me a better understanding of how to design posters and how to do a better reflection.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I liked the Padlet we used to collect feedback from peers. In the development of the process, we checked the feedback on Padlet repeatedly to make our final product better.
				</p>

				<h4>Meeting expectations</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					“I expect I will make a clear plan of the group project, have regular online meetings with my teammates, critique their work and receive a critique of my work and finally do a good project as expected. I expect we develop and reflect on the good process and achieve good progress on problem-solving, communication and self-teaching skills.” – My first journal.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Looking back to what I wrote in the first journal, I think all these original expectations were met. We divided tasks and made a clear plan for the project in Part A, and I also made an individual plan for myself to implement the tasks. I had regular meetings frequently with my teammates physically on campus instead of online discussions. We critiqued each other’s work and gave feedback during the whole development process. I like the final product we made. In this course, I learned a lot. As I wrote in the “Participation & Journaling” part, this course made me an excellent habit of keeping track of the process. And this course made me open to feedbacks and knew how to iterate the product based on feedback. Also, I felt very joyful when working together with my teammates. I think I have made good progress in communication and teamwork. During the whole development process, I encountered many difficulties, but I solved them independently by self-teaching. So, I think I also got good self-teaching skills from this course.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Overall, I’ve gotten much more out of this course than I expected at the beginning.
				</p>

				<h4>Learning across the course</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					As I wrote in the ‘Participation & Journaling’ section, I learned a lot from the journal assessment and workshop. Except for this part, I want to talk about contact sessions and other activities in this section.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I learned how to summarize my ideas and explain my design concept to the audience in a few minutes in the assessment of Poster & Pitch. In other courses, I barely do not communicate with tutors except asking questions on Piazza. However, in this course, I consulted with tutors a lot, and I asked strange peers for feedback many times. I think I have made great progress in my communication skills. And we had made three presentations of the project, including the trade show. Each presentation exercised my ability to summarize the essential points and convey them to the audience, especially the trade show. During the trade show, we talked to every people who entered our channel, introducing our website to them and answering their questions. These experiences improved my ability to communicate and made me a lot more confident.
				</p>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h4>Changes to improve</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					I think the workshop session was too short. The content of the workshop was quite useful. Although the workshop's content was fundamental and not in-depth, it still gave us a learning direction. I learned many new things from the workshop, and I explored further based on these basic knowledge. So, I think it may be better if the workshop is longer and contains more learning resources.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Also, I think it will be better if the tutor gave us feedbacks on assignments more quickly. If we received feedback before the next assignment, we could pay attention to our mistakes and do better in the next assignment.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Moreover, this course would be better if we could form our teams quicker. Because if we formed the team earlier, we would have more time for the project and make the project better. I think we formed teams a little late, and I still remembered that I felt anxious before forming teams.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I immensely enjoyed this course. Thank you, the teaching team and my teammates. I had a good time!
